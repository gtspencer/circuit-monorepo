## Circuit

`Get paid for your attention`

Circuit is a full stack app, designed to be deployed on Farcaster as a miniapp

It allows a Facaster user to pay out to users who interact with their casts.

Attention is the most valuable resource on the internet, and tipping while giving attention is backwards.

It is now defunct and open source, as Noice also did this and already have a large user base.
